# Extract-numbers-inside-boxes-from-an-image-using-Python-ML
This project aims to develop a Python-based solution leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately extract and recognize numbers within boxed areas in images. By using libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the solution will automate the extraction of numerical data from images
